                Ingredients
            </h4>
            <p>
                1 large skinless chicken breast,
                1 1/2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil,
                salt and freshly ground black pepper,
                1 large garlic clove, finely grated,
                1 tsp cumin seeds,
                good fistful of chopped coriander (cilantro),
                1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice, or to taste,
                1/2 medium-large tomato,
                1/2 ripe avocado,
                1/4 red onion (finely chopped or thinly sliced),
                handful of chopped lettuce,
                1 1/2 tsp chaat masala,
                1/4 small Indian green finger chilli (chile),
                1 1/2 tbsp salted peanuts(lightly chopped).
            </p>
            <h4>
                Direction
            </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Marinate the chicken breast with 1 tsp of the olive oil, seasoning and the garlic. Leave for 30 minutes if possible.</li>
                <li>Place the cumin seeds in a small dry frying pan over a medium heat and stir just until they turn a shade darker and smell aromatic. Remove and grind to a powder in a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder.</li>
                <li>Heat a griddle pan or frying pan, add the chicken and cook for 5–6 minutes on each side or until done. I like to cover the pan (with another pan) 2 minutes in, to keep the chicken moist.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, mix together the remaining olive oil, seasoning, roast cumin and a little each of the coriander and lemon juice.</li>
                <li>Chop the tomato and avocado into even 1 – 2cm (1/2 – 3/4 in) cubes. Place in a bowl and add the onion, lettuce, chaat masala, chilli and most of the dressing. Toss well to mix and season to taste. It should be tangy, spicy and well-seasoned. Add more lemon juice if necessary.</li>
                <li>When the chicken is done, you can slice it thinly and place on top of the salad, drizzled with the remaining dressing and remaining coriander, or chop into small bites and mix with the salad, dressing and remaining coriander. I also like the flavours to marinate for a bit before serving, so make it up 10–15 minutes before serving if possible.</li>
